<p>benefits from data mining.  Table 2 provides some representative drawbacks of data mining, once again from the three different perspectives.<br/></p>
<p><b>Does Data Mining Benefit or Harm Society?<br/></b></p>
    <p>How can governments take data from a number of different sources and mine it for possible suspects associated with terrorist acts?  In the aftermath of the World Trade Center tragedy, governments will be seeking new broad powers to monitor electronic communications in an effort to identify and locate potential terrorists.  One of the means at their disposal is to gather data from a number of different sources and use data mining to identify suspect financial transactions, which it is hoped will ultimately lead back to those who sponsor terrorism. </p>
<p>Shari Steele, an executive director of the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, a special interest group that aims to keep the Web as free and democraticas possible, is concerned about potential new powers for the government to invadepersonal privacy (Swisher, 2001):<br/></p>
<p>&#8220;Now it looks like the government will be able to know that and a whole lot more, such as from where you surf, patterns of your e-mail use, what you buy. The ability to learn these patterns has been the dream of marketers and the rallying point for privacy advocates, who have fought successfully since cyberspace&#8217;s earliest days to prevent such snooping.&#8221; (p. B1)<br/></p>
<p> Prior to the World Trade Center disaster, it would have been impossible for the government to put legislation in place that would allow it to monitor behavior on such an individual basis.  In the aftermath, it is not clear whether those who are in society who are clamoring for restraint and a reasonable response will be heard.  More than likely, their calls for a reasoned response will be drowned out by the cries of the masses for measures to safeguard society.<br/></p>
<p>Another drawback is that there can be flaws in the data-mining process.  There are a number of reasons why records in different databases&#8212;even though they actually contain information about the same person or entity&#8212;may not &#8220;match up&#8221; through the data-mining process.  Some of the difficulties that arise might be through letter, field, or word-related mismatches.  Bell and Sethi (2001), in their article, &#8220;Matching Records in a National Medical Patient Index,&#8221; examine some of the reasons why data from a number of different sources may have difficulty matching records.  Under the letter-related mismatches, transposition of letters, omission of letters, misspellings, and typing errors can occur during data entry.  With respect to word- or field-related mismatches, maybe the person whose data is contained in two different databases may have had a change of address or a change of name.  There is always the possibility of fraud, as well as change of ZIP code or change of phone number.  So, one of the concerns that consumers must have is the accuracy of mined information.  And that data from another person&#8217;s history is not accidentally&#8212;through improper matching&#8212;coupled with their own legitimate data.  In addition to the letter- and field-related mismatches, there are a number of other issues that might create inaccuracies.  For example, Asian names often have surname and given name reversal.  If someone is not aware that this is the case, then upon data entry,the names may be switched.  Another example where names may appear differently for the same individual is when a person may be named William, but is going by Bill.  Hence, through the data-mining process, these types of possibilities must be taken into account. Another problem is misspelling, e.g., when a last name might be Cook and is entered as Cooke.  Another similar example is the name Smith, which can be mistakenly spelled Smith, Smithe, or Smyth.</p>
<p>Having examined ethical and social implications, we now turn our attention to legal issues.  It is important that companies protect sensitive data while allowing key decision- makers access to real-time information online.  This next section discusses legal matters and their role in data mining.  Laws dictate what kind of data can be mined.  It is important to understand some of the federal laws currently related to privacy to understand their impact (or lack thereof) on how data is currently mined.  Following are brief descriptions of many federal laws that are important when dealing with privacy.  While reading this section, keep this in mind:  if you collect, manipulate, disseminate, and mine data, investing in legal advice is a smart decision.<br/></p>
    <center><p><b>LEGAL ISSUES<br/></b></p></center>
    <p>What is legal and what is wise often are two different things.  Given the rapidadvance in technology, it is likely that laws to protect against abuses will not be able to keep up.  However, there are existing laws that apply in specific situations, and IS professionals must be aware of these.  Sadly, many of these issues are not brought up in formal IS education and training.  It is important to remember that ignorance of the law does not constitute a defense in a court of law.  Therefore, IS professionals must educate themselves concerning existing laws, and be aware of potential future regulation so that they not only prepare their systems for such regulation, but also do not contribute to the social pressure for further government-imposed restrictions, as shown previously inFigure 1.<br/></p>
<p>Lawmakers show little interest in passing a comprehensive privacy law but rather legislate each information source separately.  Table 3 provides a brief overview of U.S. Federal regulations that both protect privacy and provide circumstances under which it may be invaded.  An interesting point to make is that, prior to September 11, 2001, if the USA Patriot Act of 2001 had been before Congress, it would have probably been considered too invasive.  However, the 9/11 attacks have changed that perception and the need for privacy in terms of balancing it with the ability to eliminate terrorism.  In the following section, a representative sample of Federal acts is discussed.  A complete and thorough discussion of all regulations concerning data collection and use is beyond the scope of this chapter.  We begin our examination of U.S. Federal regulations with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and end with a brief discussion of the USA Patriot Act of 2001. Afterwards, we briefly explore legal issues in jurisdiction outside of the United States.<br/></p>
    <p><b>Fair Credit Reporting Act<br/></b></p>
<p>Many people are concerned about using their credit card online for fear that their card information will be stolen.  Another fear with the Internet is that a person&#8217;s credit<i>Table 3:  U.S. Federal Regulations that impact privacy (Adapted from Caudill &amp;<br/>Murphy, 2000)<br/></i></p>

<p>history can be easily accessed or obtained.  With data mining, consumers are scared that their credit card information and credit history will become even more vulnerable.However, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) of 1970 already protects consumers against illegal use of credit information:</p>

<p>&#8220;Congress passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1970, in recognition of the fact that false or inaccurate information on a credit report can have serious (and embarrassing) consequences for an individual.  The act regulates the kind of information that can appear in credit reports, allows individual access to their reports, and sets up a system for an individual to contest the contents of their credit reports.&#8221; (Alley &amp; Harvey, 1998 )<br/></p>
<p> The FCRA applies to situations other than the loan- or credit-application process, such as employer background checks, court records, and motor vehicle reports, anytime the data was provided in a consumer report by a consumer-reporting agency as defined by the Act.<br/></p>
<p>Just about every aspect of the FCRA and the amendment (which went into effect in October 1997) can apply to data mining.  If a company participates in data-mining activities, it must carefully review how it uses the information in regards to the FCRA or face potential lawsuits.  A company must also be careful that the information it obtains through data mining is accurate.  Privacy is protected by the FCRA to a certain degree. This act affects data mining when the organization selling or obtaining the information can be defined as a credit-reporting agency according the FCRA.  The entire Fair Credit Reporting Act may be obtained at http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcra.htm.<br/></p>
<p><b>Right to Financial Privacy Act<br/></b></p>
   <p> An individual&#8217;s rights in guarding his or her financial information are protected by The Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978.  Most people are concerned about their financial privacy and believe it is imperative that federal law protects it.  Because of this law, procedures must be followed by banks, credit unions, credit card companies, savings and loan associations, and other financial institutions before any information about you is given to a Federal agency.  Protecting their financial information is probably one of the areas about which individuals are most concerned.  They do not want others to store and/or analyze this type of data.  As technology becomes increasingly more sophisticated, data-mining techniques will challenge this privacy act and threaten the protection it currently provides.<br/></p>
<p><b>Electronic Funds Transfer Act<br/></b></p>
    <p>The Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Act of 1978 was designed to give customers protection by assigning liability to banks that allowed electronic access to customer accounts.  There are many benefits to both the bank and individuals from the use of EFT. This act also states that customers must be notified about third-party access to their information on electronic funds transfer, either at the time that the consumer contracts for electronic funds transfer or before the first transfer is made.  ATM and debit cards have since flourished, and the flow of data and access to your finances worldwide has increased.  By taking the liability off of the consumer, the Electronic Funds Act made it possible for consumers to feel comfortable using ATM, debit cards, and, more recently, electronic funds transfer to pay almost any type of bill.</p>


<p><b>Electronic Communications Privacy Act<br/></b></p>
    <p>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) addresses the legal privacy issues involved with the use of computers and other new technology in electronic communications.  This act updated 1968 legislation that clarified invasion of privacy with the use of electronic surveillance.  This law was primarily aimed at preventing invasions of privacy by government.  However, it has not been updated to reflect the technological advancements made possible through widespread use of the Internet.  Technologies such as Carnivore collect more information than protected under the authority of this law.<br/></p>
<p><b>Video Privacy Protection Act<br/></b></p><p>The Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 states that video store owners cannot divulge information about the videos rented or personal information about the consumers who rent them to the general public.  This law was enacted to protect the privacy of consumers, in particular so that they would not be ashamed about or prosecuted for renting videos considered adult material.  The beneficial result of this law is that people feel free to rent whatever they would like, without fear.  Without this act, for example, homosexuals who are not public about their sexuality could fear that friends or employers could find out they are renting gay materials.  This law protects them from such discrimination or public ridicule.  Without this Act, individuals in high-profile jobs could reasonably fear their renting habits might be released.<br/></p>
<p><b>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)<br/></b></p>
<p>The ability to compile, store and cross-reference personally identifiable health information easily is becoming technologically feasible.  Unfortunately, patients must worry, and rightly so, about confidentiality.  Furthermore, the healthcare industry is so competitive and medical information so valuable that information that should be shared often is not.<br/></p>
<p>On August 21, 1996, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  HIPAA is designed to reduce inefficiencies in the healthcare industry by reducing paperwork, controlling abuse in the system, providing privacy protection for individuals, and ensuring health care coverage for even those with pre-existing conditions.  A provision of HIPAA required Congress to enact medical privacy protections by August of 1999.  The law also included a provision that gave the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the authority to write medical privacy regulations if Congress missed its self-imposed deadline (Leahy, 2001).<br/></p>
<p>Concerned about the loss of personal privacy and fear that if medical records were not protected from unauthorized disclosure, it would deter people from seeking medical treatment, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, in March of 1999, introduced comprehensive medical privacy legislation entitled, the Medical Information Privacy and Security Act (MIPSA).  However, it was not enacted and Congress missed the August, 1999</p>
